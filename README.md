# Code that works. Systems that scale. Work that matters.

I’m Waleed — a full-stack developer engineering scalable solutions across web, mobile, and automation systems.

With a foundation in both development and QA, I bring a cross-functional mindset to building clean, reliable software. From MERN-based dashboards and Flutter admin panels to Make.com and Google Apps Script automations, I’ve delivered real-world tools that solve real problems.

Currently in my final year at FAST University, I focus on writing maintainable code, designing structured architectures, and contributing to projects that are built to last.
